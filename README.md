# Fast Image Recognition
## Travel and Tourism
The first example I can think of where image recognition technology would be useful in terms of tourism would be by foreigners.
Naturally, visiting a new country will contain things a foreigner has never experienced.
With the help of advanced image recognition technology, unfamiliar surroundings and society can be better understood by a tourist.
A limit might be that the technology correctly defines a piece of data: giving its name, while the user still continues to be unaware of what it is. 
Informing a tourist of the name of a foreign object doesn't tell them what it is. Instead, they musk seek information elsewhere.

## Gaming and Entertainement
It is common for fast image recognition to be used among video game users. 
This can be helpful in-game to guide users throughout the course of the game: helping them locate key items in the mission.
While this might be useful for progress, it might lack specification. 
For example, picking up objects that are unnecessary to the user, therefore cluttering the screen and limiting functionality.
Also, users might find that the fast image recognition makes the game too simple: taking the fun out of it.
